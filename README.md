This is a very simple implementation of 4 state management libraries. This by no means covers advanced features of each library or showcases their paradigms. However, it's a good place to start to see how each are implemented.

To use:
  1. use `npm i` to install node modules
  2. use `npm run dev` to start local server
  3. use your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173/`
